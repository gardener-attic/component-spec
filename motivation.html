<h1>Motivation<a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Operating software installations both for Cloud and on-premises covers
many aspects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>how, when and where are the technical artefacts created</p></li>
<li><p>how are technical artefacts stored and accessed</p></li>
<li><p>which technical artefacts are to be deployed</p></li>
<li><p>how is the configuration managed</p></li>
<li><p>when are technical artefacts deployed</p></li>
<li><p>where and how are those artefacts deployed</p></li>
<li><p>which other software installations are required and how are they
deployed and accessed</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The overall problem domain has a complexity that makes it
challenging to be solved as a whole.  However, the problem domain
can be divided into two disjoint subdomains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>production of software artefacts</p></li>
<li><p>processes acting on those artefact sets like compliance
processes, transport, deployment and lifecycle management of
installations</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The elements transitioning between those two subdomains are
synchronisation data (“when things should happen”) and technical
artefacts and their purposes.</p>
<p>By standardising those elements, it is possible to decouple those
two aspects. This allows to split the overall complexity into
smaller parts. The involved artefacts are basically some kind
of source of truth, all processes during a software lifecycle
finally cooperate on these elements, they are generated by a build,
matter of compliance assessment, the have to transported and
deployed, and finally the data controlling processes like
deployment can be expressed by artefacts, also. Because of
this, it seems to be a good idea to standardize the description
and handling of software artefacts. By this, independent tools
can cooperate on such a view to software and the overall complexity
can be reduced, .</p>
<p>When dealing with aspects of software or software artefacts
like delivery, life cycle management or security aspects it is
important to reliably build the bridge between uniquely denoting
or identifying software or software parts and the real, effective
technical content behind the naming scheme.
This must be combined with the possibility to describe the access
of the real content just by the naming scheme in any kind of storage
environment, be it public or fenced local ones,
and a reliable way to transport software among such environments.
At the same time not only the sole executable artefacts must be
considered, but all other kinds of meta data or accompanying information
used to describe the artefacts, their meaning, deployment and lifecycle
aspects.</p>
<p>Although container based software systems, especially Kubernetes,
are increasingly displacing other other runtime models there will for
sure always be competing or specialized or even new upcoming ones in
the future, which must potentially be commonly described in one closed
model. Therefore such a software description model must not be related to
dedicated technologies, be it content types, runtime models or tools
working the the denoted content.</p>
<p>The Open Component Model will offer a sound common technology-agnostic
basis to denote and describe the access of any kind of software by grouping
typed artefacts and establishing a hierarchical naming scheme, which is
applicable for all content that can reliably represented as blobs.</p>
<p>Like the today’s generic file system models it can be used to store
and access any kind of data in any suitable repository or even archives
or regular file systems.</p>
<p>It acts as a common scheme for any kind of tool that can interpret or deal
with the typed artefact blobs with its own semantic to fulfill its tasks.
The common naming scheme allows to correlate artefacts described by
the model
with other tool specific data at API level and therefore enables
the cooperation of decoupled, independent tools by always keeping
the connection to the single truth, the artefacts and artefacts groups
they deal with.</p>
<p>Establishing a common, technology-agnostic and extensible model to
describe software and its artifacts provides software developers,
software vendors, and their partners with a unique way to consistently
build, deliver and deploy compliant software, based on any technology,
to any environment.</p>
<section id="core-concepts">
<h2>Core Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#core-concepts" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="concepts.html#concepts-components"><span class="std std-ref">Components</span></a> in OCM are semantical entities with a
certain semantical focus, as part of a software product. They are typically
built from <a class="reference internal" href="concepts.html#concepts-sources"><span class="std std-ref">Sources</span></a>, which are being conciously developed.</p>
<p>They consist of a set of (component) versions. Each version is described by a
<a class="reference internal" href="concepts.html#concepts-component-descriptors"><span class="std std-ref">Component Descriptor</span></a>, which describes
the included set of artefacts. <cite>Component Descriptors</cite> are stored in a
<a class="reference internal" href="concepts.html#concepts-component-repositories"><span class="std std-ref">Component Repository</span></a> in a standardized
way. Within such a component repository, component descriptors are addressed by
their component name and version.</p>
<p>By separating the storage locations (component repository) from the component version
identity, in combination with a defined addressing scheme, it is possible to
access component descriptors uniquely in any component repository, in a
location-independent manner.
This can be leveraged to replicate component descriptors and the described artefacts
between component repositories.</p>
<p>Each of the artefacts declared in a <cite>Component Descriptor</cite> has an <cite>identity</cite>, an <cite>access</cite>
description and a <cite>type</cite>. <cite>Artefact identities</cite> can be used to reference an artefact in
the context of the declaring component descriptor. The <cite>Artefact type</cite> defines how the
artefact is to be interpreted. The <cite>access Description</cite> defines from where the artefact
can be retrieved.</p>
<img alt="_images/Transport.png" src="_images/Transport.png" />
<p>When replicating component descriptors and their artefacts, the artefacts’ <cite>access</cite> descriptions
may be changed. However, <cite>artefact types</cite> and <cite>artefact identities</cite> always remain unchanged.</p>
<p>The Open Component Model can roughly be compared to a filesystem “living” in an arbitrary
storage (e.g. a blobstore, oci-registry, archive, ..).</p>
<img alt="_images/ResourceAccess.png" src="_images/ResourceAccess.png" />
<p>Starting from an arbitrary component repository used as root repository it is
possible to access any artefact described by the component model as long as the
dedicated component version has been imported into this repository. The
dedicated component repository together with the component version identity
allows to access the component descriptor which then is used to determine the
access for dedicated artefacts given by their local identity. This way the
component respository acts as composed filesystem with fixed top level folders,
the components and their versions, followed by the artefact level, which then
may point into any another (kind of) repository. Sub folders can be described
by component version references described by component descriptors, which again
feature a local identity in the describing component descriptor.</p>
</section>
<section id="scope-definition">
<h2>Scope Definition<a class="headerlink" href="#scope-definition" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The Open Component model intends to solve the problem of addressing,
identifying, and accessing artefacts for software components, relative to an
arbitrary component repository. By that, it also enables the transport of
software components between component repositories.</p>
<p>Through the standardisation of structure and <cite>access</cite> to artefacts, it can serve as an
interface to any operation or tool that needs to interact with the content.
This allows for tools operating against this interface to be implemented in a
re-usable, and technology-agnostic manner (examples being transport,
compliance and security scanning, codesigning, ..).</p>
<p>Higherlevel functionality, such as deployment, or lifecycle-management aspects are
out of the scope the Open Component Model targets. However, it acts as a container to
host (access, transport, …) information for those processes. Data for such
aspects (for example a deployment blueprint) can, be described by the Open Component Model
as dedicated typed artefacts. This is equivalent to e.g. adding a <cite>Makefile</cite>
into a filesystem. The filesystem does not “know” about the semantics of the
<cite>Makefile</cite> (including, e.g. declared dependencies towards other files).</p>
<p>An example for such a tool is the Landscaper.
With the Landscaper, a new open, technology-agnostic and extensible deployment
control tool is established on top of this software description model.
Based on deployment descriptions, the Blueprints, and additional artefact information
taken from the component model, it orchestrates and configures desired states in
a Kubernetes-like manner that are finally handled by type specific Deployers which
control the actual technology-specific deployment steps. Based on a very small set
of standard Kubernetes-based deployers, any other kind of deployer can be added as
part of the deployment process to support deployments in any technical or even
fenced environment.  The complete data plane is maintained in a Kubernetes system
and can be maintained by traditional GitOps processes configuring installations
based on artefacts uniformly described by and accessed using the open component model.</p>
<p>The combination of both parts, the Open Component Model and the Landscaper makes
complete heterogeneous scenarios, including the required software parts and their
orchestrations, transportable among and executable in any local and independent
repository landscapes, controlled by local GitOps processes.</p>
